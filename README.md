# Interactive Crystallography Tutorial

**Warning: work in progress!**

## Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to give learners a better way to learn the key concepts behind crystallography: interactive visualization. While some people have no problem working with math on paper, others need more visuals to help them fully understand the mathematical concepts. I fall somewhere in-between. For simpler concepts, I have no issue understanding the mathematics. But as the topics get more complex, I struggle without some visualization. Furthermore, visualization is not always as good as it could be because most published figures rely on the author choosing a good example. My goal is to go one step beyond, taking advantage of "publishing" on the internet, to make interactive figures.

## Inspiration

I was reading someone else's brief introduction to crystallography and, while good, it did not visualize some concepts that I thought were important. I want to expand on the tutorial to provide a better aid and provide a place that students can go back to for re-learn.
